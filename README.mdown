SArtFileTool for Lion & Snow Leopard
===================================
SArtFileTool is a command line tool for encoding and decoding the ArtFile.bin found in `/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CoreUI.framework/Versions/A/SArtFile.bin`. It its current state it can flawlessly decode SArtFile.bin and ArtFile.bin. Excuse my messy code! You can find the ArtFile.bin counterpart [here!](https://github.com/alexzielenski/artFileTool)
